## About Sakhi Foundation

Menstrual hygiene is a crucial aspect of a woman's overall health and well-being. Unfortunately, many women in rural areas are forced to use traditional cloth during their menstrual cycles due to a lack of access to affordable and sanitary menstrual products. The **Sakhi Foundation** has been established to address this issue and promote better menstrual health practices among these women.

## Project Goals

The main goals of Sakhi Foundation are:

1. **Provide Sanitary Pads**: We aim to distribute sanitary pads to women in rural areas, ensuring they have access to safe and hygienic menstrual products.

2. **Raise Awareness**: In addition to providing sanitary pads, we work diligently to educate women and communities about menstrual health, hygiene, and the importance of using proper menstrual products.

3. **Empower Women**: Through our initiatives, we strive to empower women by giving them the knowledge and resources they need to manage their menstrual health effectively.

## Features

- **Sanitary Pad Distribution**: Our website allows users to request and receive sanitary pads at their doorstep.

- **Educational Resources**: We provide informative articles, videos, and resources about menstrual health and hygiene.
