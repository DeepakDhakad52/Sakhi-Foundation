    <h1>When to see your Doctor in Menstrual cycle</h1>
    <div class="content">
        <p>As a natural process that occurs in the female reproductive system, menstruation is a regular occurrence for most women. However, there are times when menstrual cycles can be irregular or accompanied by unusual symptoms that may require medical attention. Here are some signs that you should see your doctor during your menstrual cycle:</p>
    </div>

    <div class="content">
        <h3>Irregular Cycles:</h3>
        <p>While a normal menstrual cycle lasts for 28 days, cycles that are shorter or longer than this can be considered irregular. If you experience irregular periods, where the length of your menstrual cycle varies from month to month or lasts for more than 35 days, you should consult your doctor. Irregular cycles can be a sign of hormonal imbalances or underlying medical conditions such as polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), thyroid problems, or uterine fibroids.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="content">
        <h3>Severe Pain:</h3>
        <p>While mild cramping during periods is normal, severe pain that affects your daily activities can be a sign of an underlying medical condition. If you experience severe pain during your menstrual cycle, which is not relieved by over-the-counter pain medications, you should seek medical attention. Severe pain can be caused by conditions such as endometriosis, uterine fibroids, or pelvic inflammatory disease (PID).</p>
    </div>

    <div class="content">
        <h3>Heavy Bleeding:</h3>
        <p>If you experience heavy bleeding during your period, which lasts for more than seven days or requires changing your pad or tampon every hour, you should see your doctor. Heavy bleeding can be a sign of an underlying medical condition such as uterine fibroids, endometriosis, or bleeding disorders.</p>

    </div>

    <div class="content">
        <h3>Abnormal Discharge:</h3>
        <p>While some amount of vaginal discharge is normal, if you experience abnormal discharge during your menstrual cycle, you should consult your doctor. Abnormal discharge can be a sign of a bacterial or yeast infection, sexually transmitted infection (STI), or cervical cancer.</p>

    </div>
    

    <div class="content">
        <h3>Missed Periods:</h3>
        <p>If you miss your period for more than three months, you should seek medical attention. Missed periods can be a sign of pregnancy, hormonal imbalances, or underlying medical conditions such as PCOS or thyroid problems.</p>

    </div>

    <div class="content">
        <h3>Conclusion:</h3>
        <p>While menstruation is a natural process, there are times when you should seek medical attention during your menstrual cycle. If you experience irregular cycles, severe pain, heavy bleeding, abnormal discharge, or missed periods, you should consult your doctor. Early detection and treatment of underlying medical conditions can help prevent complications and promote reproductive health. Regular gynecological check-ups and open communication with your doctor about any concerns related to your menstrual cycle can help promote overall health and well-being.</p>
